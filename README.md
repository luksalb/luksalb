## You were trying to cross the border, right?
Hi! Name's Lucas. I'm currently living in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil and I work with Tech for quite some time. My goal here is to improve, work and help others. <br>


## About me:
* **Name**: Lucas Alberto
* **Age**: 27
* **Stack**: C# - ASP.NET - JavaScript - SQL - AWS - Azure

## Random info:
* My very first job was as an IT Operator, whatever that was, when I was 17 years old.
* I'm fluent in english since I was a kid and eventually worked as an English Teacher. I know how to speak spanish and I can understand japanese.
* Always liked playing with my friends, which made me have the need to maintain servers of Minecraft, Pirates Online and once even GTA SA. 
* I have worked in different ares of I.T by fixing computers; **managing**: network, people, contracts and systems. Now I create and fix systems myself (also manage it).
* My **Goal** for this year is to improve my code so I can depend less and help more. Also, create healthy habits (making mods on terraria is considered healthy, *right*?)
* I'm married to the most beautiful woman this universe has ever seen.
